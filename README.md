# :postbox: About Me
My name is Aidan and I am a Computer Science student!

```java
public class Aidan
{
  private int age = 18;
  public String[] traits = new String[] { "dumb", "short", "nerd" };
  public String[] hobbies = new String[] { "Coding!", "Ultimate Frisbee", "Chess", "Wrestling", "Sleeping" };
}
```

I have been interested in coding from the ripe age of 11 years old. I started off coding using block Scratch code and grew to learn line langauges such as Python and Java. At 13 I used my Java knowledge to experiment with Minecraft plugins and started to create my own. At around 14 - 15 I started to try creating my own games in Unity, where I dipped my toes into C#. Now I am playing around with Web Design and languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have tried tools such as Node.js and React, however, I am still learning!
